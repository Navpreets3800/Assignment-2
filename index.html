        <p class="first">I found a love, for me <br>
        Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead <br>
        Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet <br>
        Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
        
        
        <p class="second">'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love <br>
        Not knowing what it was <br>
        I will not give you up this time <br>
        But darling, just kiss me slow <br>
        Your heart is all I own <br>
        And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>


        <p class="third">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br>
        With you between my arms <br>
        Barefoot on the grass <br>
        Listening to our favourite song <br>
        When you said you looked a mess <br>
        I whispered underneath my breath <br>
        But you heard it <br>
        Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>


        <p class="fourth">Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know <br>
        She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home <br>
        I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets <br>
        To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>


        <p class="fifth">We are still kids, but we're so in love <br>
        Fighting against all odds <br>
        I know we'll be alright this time <br>
        Darling, just hold my hand <br>
        Be my girl, I'll be your man <br>
        I see my future in your eyes</p>


        <p class="sixth">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br>
        With you between my arms <br>
        Barefoot on the grass <br>
        Listening to our favorite song <br>
        When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful <br>
        I don't deserve this <br>
        Darling, you look perfect tonight</p>


        <p class="seventh"> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark <br>
        With you between my arms <br>
        Barefoot on the grass <br>
        Listening to our favorite song <br>
        I have faith in what I see <br>
        Now I know I have met an angel in person <br>
        And she looks perfect</p>
